# Banking Marketing Analysis to Increase Campaign Success

This project aims to optimize marketing strategies within the banking industry by understanding the factors influencing customer decisions to subscribe to deposits. The goal is to increase the success rate of deposit marketing campaigns by 20% over a period of 6 months. Understanding customer profiles better can help maintain the bank's reputation in a highly competitive banking industry.

To achieve this project's goal, it's essential to address the following problem: In the increasingly competitive banking industry, it's crucial for banks to optimize marketing strategies to enhance the success of deposit marketing campaigns by 20%. This involves identifying the factors influencing customer decisions to subscribe to deposits, thereby maintaining the bank's reputation over 6 months.

To tackle this problem, I've established a SMART framework, where these five elements are crucial in clarifying the project's ultimate vision:
